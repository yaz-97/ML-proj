Fundamental Analysis and Interpretation of Results

The provided code is a machine learning model that predicts whether a person plays video games based on their profile data. The profile data includes features such as age, gender, student status, favorite game, and reason for playing games. The model is trained using a dataset named ‘VideoGameUsage_Profile.csv’.

The model is a sequential model with two dense layers. The first layer has 32 units with a ‘relu’ activation function, and the second layer which is the output layer has 3 units with a ‘softmax’ activation function. The model uses ‘categoricalCrossentropy’ as the loss function and ‘adam’ optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01. The model’s performance is evaluated using accuracy.

The model is trained for 10 epochs. The training process includes a callback function that logs the loss and accuracy at the end of each epoch. The model is then evaluated on the same data, and the evaluation results are logged.

it appears that the model’s loss decreases and accuracy increases over the epochs, indicating that the model is learning from the data.
